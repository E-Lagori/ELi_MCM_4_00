Libraries for E-LAGORi boards - Microcontroller modules


The controller board is the brain of any embedded system. Many different types of controller boards are available in the E-Lagori platform. 

Brief discription of available boards are listed here. 


ESP32-WROVER processing module
-------------------------------
The ESP32-WROVER processing module is a latest version of the ESP32 WROVER - 32E/IE SOC which has inbuilt bluetooth, 
Wifi and 16MB of flash memory inbuilt. It also has the latest version of a 32 bit dual core processor. 
The module is capable of SPI, I2C communication and also provides 12 bit ADC and DAC. 
The E-Lagori enhances the system by providing a 1:16 analog mux and FTDI chip for USB to serial conversion. 
A USB port connected to the power supply board can be used to program the processor which could be connected anywhere in the stack. 
Serial port communication can also be achieved through the same USB port. 
The MUX allows access to input pins (I_A to I_P) of the E-LAGORi board and also provides output to sockets (O_A to O_P).
